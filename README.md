My name is Nicolas Gonzalez, and I am recent graduate of the Master of Science in Business Analytics program at Southern New Hampshire University. As a passionate and driven individual, I am actively seeking an internship opportunity for Fall 2023 in the field of data analysis, business analysis, business intelligence or related fields.

Throughout my academic journey, I have gained a solid foundation in statistical analysis, data visualization, and business strategy. My coursework has equipped me with hands-on experience in programming languages like R and Python, as well as various tools like Tableau and SQL.

Apart from my academic experience, I have also worked on several group projects and case studies that have honed my team-working and communication skills. I am confident that my analytical and interpersonal skills will enable me to make a meaningful contribution to any team I work with.

I am excited to apply my knowledge and skills in a professional setting and am committed to taking on new challenges and learning opportunities. If you know of any potential internship opportunities or would like to connect with me, please feel free to contact me via email or LinkedIn.
